# metric-suite
This project creates a software metrics tool that can be used to calculate software quality in a variety of ways.
It is a desktop application that can calculate some of the most critical software metrics such as Functional Point Analysis, Use-Case Points and Software Maturity Index.
It also gives the user the option of creating projects, adding extra metrics and data to the application.
